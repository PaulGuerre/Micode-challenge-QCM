# Micode challenge : create a functional MCQ website in 2 hours

## Time

I spent 1 hour and a half on this project, the following code is the result of this time.

## Functionalities

On the website, you can choose an answer in the list of displayed ones, and then click on the "Next" button to go to the next question. At the end, you can see your score. As long as you do not have clicked on the "Next" button, you can change your answer.

## Technologies

For this project, I decided to try Next.js. I know it's probably not the best framework for that kind of really lightweight project, but it was also the occasion to try something else! Feel free to explore the code, and to give me feedbacks on it!
